Introduction
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt/introyt1_tutorial.html
- Lays out basic steps of implementing a simple PyTorch image labeler
- Shows basic usage of Tensors
- Breaks down basic steps of machine learning:
  1. Setting up transform functions for data
  2. Importing training and testing data
  3. Using DataLoader on datasets
  4. Visuallize small batches of data as good practice
  5. Running general learning (forward pass, backprop, zero grad, optimize)
